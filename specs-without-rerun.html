# Specs without rerun

How to write (slightly more) bullet-proof specs

===

## Your examples are not alone

---
### Your ids will change

* Even when using transactions, the ids will be incremented in the dabase
* Don't expect your ids to be the same if several other examples have occured before

```ruby
# Bad
expect(payload[:company_id]).to eq 1 # => Will work when running the file alone

# Good
expect(payload[:company_id]).to eq company.id
```

---

### Defining classes in a spec file

* Prefer anonymous classes for testing purposes
* By doing so, you will avoid any name colision

```ruby
# Bad (if the name of the class is used in another spec file)
class TestClass
  ...
end

TestClass.new

# Good
klass = Class.new do
end

instance = klass.new
```

---

### Disable caching for Rails.cache.fetch

* `Rails.cache.fetch` just ignores the configuration of the cache except for the cache store
* This has been fixed and should not happen again

```ruby
# In config/environments/test.rb
config.cache_store = [:null_store]
```
===

## Database and indexes

---
### RSpec Hooks

* The `before(:all)` and `after(:all)` hooks are not in a database transaction
* This means everything created in them will be persisted to the next spec
* You have to remove these records manually

```ruby
# Bad
before(:all) do
  @job_offer = FactoryGirl.create(:job_offer)
end

# Good
before(:all) do
  @job_offer = FactoryGirl.create(:job_offer)
end

after(:all) do
  @job_offer.destroy # Will clean the ES index
end

# Good
before(:all) do
  @job_offer = FactoryGirl.create(:job_offer)
end

after(:all) do
  after_all_cleanup # Reset all the MySQL database but doesn't touch the ES index
end
```

---

### Transactions around examples

* Another danger of using the `:all` hooks is that the object you test may be altered between two examples
* Make sure to use `ActiveRecord::Base#reload` before each example
* The transaction around the example will reset the object to its initial state
* Be on the look for memoized methods, they will not be reset when using `reload`

```ruby
before(:all) do
  @job_offer = FactoryGirl.create(:job_offer, active: true)
end

after(:all) { ... }

before(:each) { @job_offer.reload } # Without this line the examples will fail randomly

it ... do
  @job_offer.active = false
  ...
end

it ... do
  expect(@job_offer).active.to be true
end

```
---

### Don't use sleep when waiting for an index to be ready

```ruby
# Bad
JobOffer.create(...)
sleep 0.5 # Not sure that the index will be ready even after waiting for 0.5 seconds
JobOffer.search(...)

# Good
JobOffer.create(...)
JobOffer.index.refresh
JobOffer.search(...)
```

## Case study

---

### Symptoms

* A bunch of examples from the API controller are failing
* No error is raised, the expected results just aren't met
* The output is different for each example
* The special error handling of the API controller makes it difficult to find where the current data is different than the expected data

---

### The hunt part 1

* Method 1 - Wild guess: fail
* Method 2 - Breakpoint: fail (either it isn't reached at all or I just cannot figure what is wrong)
* At this point, it would have been a good idea to check if some examples were easier to debug than others, but having no idea they were linked together, I started with the first one
* I try to add a breakpoint earlier in the example, but it sends me through the whole Rails stack so I cannot reach our code

-

The methods I use 99% of the time will not be enough

---

### The hunt part 2

* In the middle of the stack, I have the idea to put a breakpoint in the controller to check something
* Since the controller has already been loaded, I'm forced to reload the file after adding the breakpoint
* Magic: After that, all the examples are running fine (!)

-

Reloading the code of the controller before running the example fixes the issue

--- 

### The hunt part 3

```ruby
Api::JobNetwork::V1::JobOffersController.new.methods.sort.each do |m|
  mapping[m] = instance.method(m).source_location.try(:join, ':')
end
```

* I run to the breakpoint again and use this snippet to find the differences in the code before and after reloading the controller
* There is indeed a difference: a callback is missing, but it refers to a dynamicaly generated method name, so no luck finding which one
* Let's search the code for any occurence of the `Api::JobNetwork::V1::JobOffersController`, nothing catches my eye
* Add a listener on every call of `require` to find in which file did the code change, but there is too much noise and I see nothing

-

I know the code has changed, but cannot find what has been changed or when it has been changed

---

### The hunt part 4

* Bring out the big guns: `Tracer`
* Start a tracer at the beginning of the example (and stop it at the end)
* Wasn't fond of this at first, because I thought it was going to be painful, but worked like a charm

```ruby
  Tracer.on
  Tracer.add_filter do |event, file, line, id, binding, klass, *rest|
    file =~ %r{/app/}
  end
  
  # Run the example

  Tracer.off
```

* By reading the trace, I see I'm in a place I'm not supposed to be (there is a nil variable, and a before filter is supposed to enforce a non-nil variable)
* A quick search on this before filter leads me to this:

```ruby
described_class.skip_before_filter :authenticate_api_job_offers!
```

-

Here's the culprit, the fix takes two more seconds.


---

### Lesson learned

* Using the tracer isn't that much of a hassle, and can save a whole lot of time
* Make sure to never alter the code of the application from your examples
