# Services 

<br>

### An architectural proposition

===

## Services

> Services are unassociated, loosely coupled units of functionality that are self-contained.

<br>

Its a code **organization** pattern

---

### Key points

* Black boxes with public API

* Speak a standard language

* Isolated from each other

* Data AND/OR functionality

* (Bonus) re-usable

---

It&#39;s like developing / using internal apps with APIs

---

### SOA?

* Very broad term

* Enterprise connotations

===

## Isolation

---

* At the model / business / library layer

* We still need **dumb** controllers for

  * Routing

  * Orchestration

  * Rendering

---

 * Code is **not** shared

 * Models are **not** shared

 * Public interface that speaks primitives (JSON-able)

---

### Isolation levels

1. Code-level only

2. Self-hosted, shared database

3. Self hosted, different database

---

### However

You can (and should) call services from other services

===

## Advantages

---

### Robustness

 * No side effects

 * Fully tested

 * Mockable

---

### Performance

 * Caching-friendly

 * Profilable / Optimizable 
   <br><small>code AND datastore</small>

 * Horizontally scalable

---

### Process

 * Handle growing teams

 * Separately deployable

 * Versionable

---

### Developer-friendly

 * Can fit on one&#39;s head

 * Allow tech experimentation

 * Code ownership

===


## Caveats

---

* Services Orchestration

* Heavy functional changes

* Performance impact

===

# SOA in Rails

===

## Isolation

* Data AND/OR functionality

* Via modules

===

## The public API / client

* Most important part

* Static interface

* Speaks primitives or JSON

* RESTful better if applicable

---

```

Recommendations::Client.get_recommended_job_offers(
  4, # The student's id
  page: 2,
  per_page: 5,
  order: 'relevance',
  filters: {
    published_since: (Date.today - 1.week).to_i
  }
)

=> { 
  status: 200, 
  response: { 
    total: 124, 
    offer_ids: [ 8543, 65978, 3244, 54756, 75732 ] 
  } 
}

```

---

### Important bits

 * Could be local or remote

 * Could call other services or an internal store

 * Could have been fetched synchronously or in a cache

 * ** We don't care**

===

## Sample implementation

---

```bash
services
 - recommendations
   - client.rb
   - doc.md
   - lib
     - cache
     - models
     - engine
     - controller.rb
     - presenter.rb
   - specs
```

---

* client
* controller + presenter
* business (models / logic) + tests

---

### The client / mocks

 * Only shared code

 * Convert calls to requests
 <br>
 <small>Basically `to_json`</small>

 * May issue / handle HTTP call

 * Handles versioning

---

### The controller / presenter

 * Route requests

 * Parses params
 
 * Format and sends response

---

### The business logic

 * Namespaces so no conflicts

 * No shared code with other services

 * May have own models / datastore

===

## In more details

---

### What goes elsewhere?

 * **core app**
   * High-level logic
   * Sessions handling
   * Rendering
 
 * **libs/gems**
   * Shared technical dependencies

 * **specs**
   * Integration suite

---

### What about shared models?

 * **A.** Extract in a separate service

 * **B.** Split into private sub-models

 * **C.** Just use ids and manual joins

 * Use hooks for callbacks

===

### Presenter?

 > Have a **single** representation for resources returned by data services

 * easier to use

 * easier to mock

 * easier to cache

===

## Tools

* VCR

* HTTParty / typhoeus

* Draper

* Sinatra

* fdoc / swagger / ... (?)

===

# SOA @ jobteaser

===

### Graceful introduction

 1. New code in a client

 2. Spec it fully

 3. Move existing code by pieces

 4. Finish last touches

 5. Deploy it separately

---

### Services

 * Auth / SSO

 * Student Preferences

 * Job Offers / Events

 * Mailing cycle

 * Permissions

 * ...

---

### Core App

 * Sessions

 * App configuration (intranet)

 * Templates (logic-less)
