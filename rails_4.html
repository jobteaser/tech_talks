# Rails 4

What has changed?

<!--[Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)-->


===

## Configuration

Eager loading of the code has been disabled in development/test and enabled in production/staging

This means faster boot time in development/test as the code will be loaded as it is needed

---

### Secret keys

* Added a custom secret key for Devise
* The Rails secret key is now accessible with `JobteaserCom::Application.config.secret_key_base`

===

## Routes

New routes localisation gem 'route_translator'

[Check it out here](https://github.com/Ghrind/route_translator)

---

### No more default_url_options

* They weren't working as expected
* Default locale is enforced in the routes
* Current locale is enforced by route_translator

---

### Default subdomain

* Remember to use the **www** subdomain when there is no school subdomain
* Good: **www**.staging.jobteaser.com
* Bad: staging.jobteaser.com

---

### Enforce verb in **routes.rb**

```ruby
# Bad
match '/providers', to: 'providers#index'

# Good
get '/providers', to: 'providers#index'

# Good
match '/foobar_callback', to: 'foobars#callback', via: [:get, :post]

````

===

## ActiveRecord

By default Rails 4 prohibits using params to do mass assignement on an `ActiveRecord` model

For now, this default is overidden in `config/application.rb`

```ruby
config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = false
```

This shouldn't stop us from using [strong parameters](://github.com/rails/strong_parameters)

---

### Friendly finder

The newest version of `friendly` changes its behavior

```ruby
# Before
School.find('essec')

# Now
School.friendly.find('essec')
```

The **old behavior** has been enforced with `lib/friendly_additions.rb`

===

## Devise

When sending an email with a password recovery token, the user token is not sent in the email anymore, instead we used another token generated from the user token

[You can check the PR here](https://github.com/jobteaser/jobteaser/pull/2615/files)

---

### Unique key in params

To make `Devise` work properly, the user `unique_key` is injected in the request by a middleware

You can check it at `app/middleware/inject_unique_key_in_params.rb`

===

## Specs
* Upgrade to **RSpec 3**
* Old syntax is still supported through:
  * `rspec-its`
  * `rspec-collection_matchers`
  * `rspec-activemodel-mocks`
* Allow capybara to visit any url
* Use `infer_spec_type_from_file_location` to find the subject type automatically

---

### Timecop

```ruby
# Bad
before do
  Time.stub(:now) { '15/07/2014'.to_time }
end

# Good
before do
  Timecop.freeze('15/07/2014'.to_time)
end

after do
  Timecop.return
end

```
---

### `pending` versus `skip`

RSpec now runs the specs marked as pending and fails if the test is running properly (yes, you read that right)

The good way to prohibit a spec from running is to use `skip`

```ruby
# Bad
pending 'This test will run and fail'

# Good
skip 'This test will not run'

```

---

### RSpec 3 `should` syntax

**Not mandatory for now**

```ruby
# Bad
expression.should eq false

# Good
expect(expession).to eq false
```

---

### `be_false` and `be_true`

```ruby
# Bad
expect(expession).to be_true
expect(expession).to be_false

# Good - When the expression is exactly true or false
expect(expession).to eq true
expect(expession).to eq false

# Good - When the expression is true or false on ruby terms
expect(nil).to be_falsey # => This will pass
expect('foobar').to be_truthy # => This will pass

```

[More on that subject](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/issues/283)

===

## Deprecation warnings

* Use serialized_attributes as a class method and not an instance method
* Remove config.whiny_nils
* There is probably **more** :)

---

### Observers

* Replace `#transaction_include_action?` by `#transaction_include_any_action?`

```ruby
# Bad
transaction_include_action?(:create)

# Good
transaction_include_any_action?([:create])
```

---

### Rewrite **scopes** to use procs

```ruby
# Bad
scope :foobar, conditions: { active: true }

# Good
scope :foobar, -> { where active: true }
```

---

### Find or initialize

```ruby
# Bad
find_or_initialize_by_name(name)

# Good
find_or_initialize_by(name: name)

```

---

### `ActiveRecord::Base#all`

```ruby
# Bad
School.active.all

# Good - Query will be executed when we need the collection
School.active
School.active.class # => ActiveRecord::Relation::ActiveRecord_Relation_School

# Good - Query will be executed now
School.active.to_a
School.active.to_a.class # => Array
```

===

## Misc

* The **cell** view renderer has been removed
* Upgraded gibbon (the **mailchimp** library) from 0.3.0 to 1.1.5
* Make `ExportFile#file_path` a public method because it is called from another class
* Replace dashes by underscores in partial names

---

### Regular expressions

Using `^` or `$` when validating an attibute is forbidden

```ruby
# Bad
validate :name, with: { format: /^(.*)$/ }

# Good
validate :name, with: { format: /\A(.*)\z/ }
```

---

### `Rack::Rewrite` middleware

It is now included before `Rack::Runtime` instead of `Rack::Lock`, which wasn't always included depending on the environment

---

### Asset pipeline

* Assets are not minimized nor compressed in a single file in development environment
* The application is initialized when precompiling assets (needed for the i18n-js file)
* The `:defaults` expansion when including javascripts has been removed
* Change JQuery UI JS filename from `jquery.ui.all` to `jquery-ui` (new version of the gem)
